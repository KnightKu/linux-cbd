 *
 * The function first calculates the requested range and checks if it fits within the

 * and performs a search to locate any matching keys. If there are outdated keys,
 * these are deleted, and the search is restarted to ensure accurate data retrieval.

 * - It allocates the required cache segment and initializes the `cbd_cache_key` position
 *   within the segment.
 * - Data is then copied from the request (`cbd_req`) to the cache segment referenced by
 *   the `cbd_cache_key`.
 *
 * The function then proceeds to insert the key into the cache tree, allowing it to be
 * retrieved on read operations. After successful insertion, the `cache_key_append` function
 * is called to add `cbd_cache_key` to the current kset. This operation ensures persistence
